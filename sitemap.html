It is vital that all activities ensure the equitable participation of stakeholders, including often marginalized populations such as women, the poor, vulnerable groups and indigenous peoples. Moreover, it is important that the social and environmental dimensions be well-integrated with each other, rather than considered as separate elements.

This requires a broad understanding of the international and intergovernmental context surrounding REDD+, the various approaches undertaken by national governments and stakeholders to implement REDD+, and the diverse activities supported by USAID and international partners to realize national and international policy and technical advances. While each thematic task has a specific-focus, they cannot achieve the desired outcomes of REDD+ if they are addressed in isolation from the other core elements. Targeted and focused coordination efforts will maximize the value of an integrated approach to FCMC implementation, promote economies of scale and foster the integration of key USAID priorities, such as gender, biodiversity and development best practices across all FCMC work.  One example that illustrates an integrated and cross-cutting approach is a series of USAID program and/or project technical and capacity assessments. Integrated REDD+ Assessments of Peru and Ecuador addressing SES, FCM and MRV (Peru) has been completed and all 4 task areas in Ecuador. FCMC has also completed a revision of an Africa REDD+ assessment tool, requested by the USAID Africa Bureau.  An additional set of proposed assessments is of USAID sustainable landscapes (or REDD+) projects. This effort will include cataloging and mapping USAID sustainable landscape investments, a desktop review of existing projects, and assessing GHG and other impacts of these projects. FCMC is working with members of the Alliance for Global REDD+ Capacity to identify areas of support that will assist that Alliance meet its objectives of providing the expertise, training and tools required by REDD+ stakeholders to enhance the potential for REDD+ long-term success." class="state-published contenttype-folder">

The crisis also has a human toll: in the last decade, more than 1,000 rangers have lost their lives protecting wildlife. Criminal networks that are increasingly involved in wildlife trafficking are more organized, sophisticated, and technologically advanced than ever before. For this reason, the Wildlife Crime Tech Challenge called on the global community to harness the power of science and technology to address four wildlife-trafficking related issues." class="state-published contenttype-folder">
