<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This report describes examples of both successful and unsuccessful management of natural resources by local institutions. Analysis of these cases focuses on several conditions that appear to increase the likelihood of sustainable management. General actions that may contribute to establishing the conditions are suggested. The report also attempts to provide examples of what can happen with local management of natural resources under certain conditions. By focusing on, and explaining a set of conditions that promotes sustainable natural resource management, this analysis helps to refine the analytical and predictive capabilities, and evaluate resource management options.</p>

Technical and managerial problems may require outside expertise, but ultimately intimate knowledge of a local environment, especially under changing conditions (seasonality of resource abundance, migration, etc.), is required to accommodate rule adaptations and to ensure effective monitoring and enforcement. Local understanding of technical resource issues, as well as the investments communities have made over time to solve these issues, is manifest as the communities social capital. Natural resource problems would more likely be solved if existing social capital is harnessed rather than ignored.” (p. 53)</li>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper explores how community involvement in tourism (CIT) can contribute to development and conservation perspectives, and how the objectives may conflict or complement each other. It questions whether CIT can achieve its high expectations. It summarizes some of the advantages and limitations of community involvement in tourism, identifies key issues based on experience to date and identifies challenges to be researched and addressed. The aim is to stimulate discussion and further sharing of experience, not to provide conclusive answers. It draws mainly on examples from southern and eastern Africa.</p>

<li><em>References/Citations: CBNRM&gt;Economic Factors&gt;Financial Resources</em> — “Cooperation with the private sector: Most rural economies lack capital, business skills and international marketing links. Therefore small-scale locally-run enterprises may well be feasible, but community involvement in more sophisticated and profitable enterprises (safari hunting, luxury tours) probably will require inputs from the private sector. How can normal patterns of private sector involvement be adapted so that residents are not just employees, but communities have some choice and control, and act as partners? This is not likely to be easy. Establishing cooperation between communities and investors involves a lot of time, effort, and communication, (significant “transaction costs”) to develop ways of working together and find compromises of mutual benefit. Private operators are unlikely to want to enter into partnerships for the sake of it — only if they are necessary to secure profit or decrease risk in some way…” (p. 11)</li>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents CLUSA’s approach to natural resource management, which encourages active participation of local people in the improvement and subsequent protection of forests and other natural resources. The approach is built on a system of decentralized, village-based training that conforms to adult education principles. It emphasizes the development of three key capacities for both the local people managing natural resources and the technicians assisting them:</p>
<p>- the capacity to establish management structures (committees, boards of directors, etc.) capable of developing, implementing, and evaluating their own resource management plans;</p>
<p>- the capacity to create and operate rural group businesses based on profitable economic activities related to the harvesting of forest products; and</p>
<p>- the capacity to develop and implement rational management plans for forest-related economic activities.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper describes how the Governance and Local Democracy (GOLD) Project, as one of its principal action areas, undertook the task of assisting provinces, cities and municipalities to take an active role in assessing, monitoring and managing natural resources within their jurisdiction, in collaboration with civic institutions. To achieve this, the GOLD Project developed a “toolbox” of seven participatory techniques and technical assistance events that could be applied to a wide variety of resource management challenges: 1) local government strategic planning workshops 2) multisector technical working groups 3) community environmental action planning workshops 4) environmental summits 5) participatory environmental transects 6) co-management agreements, and 7) technical review/training workshops. <a name="_Hlt511794899" id="_Hlt511794899"></a></p>

Paper presented at the 1998 International Workshop on CBNRM, Washington, DC.<em><br /></em><strong>Abstract</strong>: This paper draws on the experiences of the Nusa Tenggara Uplands Development Consortium, an inter-agency network which seeks to address key technical, institutional and policy issues related to poverty alleviation and environmental conservation in the Nusa Tenggara region of eastern Indonesia. In the past three years, the Consortium’s Conservation Working Group has catalyzed and monitored the emergence of new collaborative alliances addressing the challenges of forest and conservation management in several priority conservation sites across the region. The paper summarizes the evolution of this network and the lessons learned in mitigating conflicts and building collaborative approaches to forest management. Key interventions developed to facilitate these multistakeholder approaches to forest management have included community organizing, coalition building, participatory research, training and capacity building, along with a variety of innovative strategies for convening diverse stakeholder groups at both the local and regional level.<em> <a name="_Hlt508092549" id="_Hlt508092549"></a><a name="_Hlt511794969" id="_Hlt511794969"></a><a name="_Hlt511795038" id="_Hlt511795038"></a></em></p>

<p class="Level1"><strong>Abstract:</strong> This document presents a framework to explain how CBNRM programs can help people see that it is in their own best interest to use resources sustainably, gives them the tools to do so and helps establish the conditions to use these tools. The framework presented by Gambill is based on the economic principle that people use resources in the way that provides them the most benefit. As a result, he focuses on how CBNRM activities can increase expected benefits [where expected benefits are defined as = (likelihood of obtaining benefit) x (benefit value)], by increasing both the likelihood of obtaining future benefits and the benefit value.</p>
<p class="Level1"> </p>
<p>· References/Citations: CBNRM&gt;Political Factors&gt;Legal Factors&gt;Security of Tenure — “Increase the likelihood of benefiting from sustainable use: Successful CBNRM programs help communities feel more certain of obtaining benefits from resources in two ways — they ensure the community controls the resource, and they provide information needed to use the resource sustainably. Establishing effective control of community-managed resources is critical for CBNRM to succeed. By controlling a resource, the community can be certain that they can use the resource tomorrow, if they preserve it today. While control of a resource is necessary to use it sustainably, it is not sufficient. Communities also need information and skills to manage and sustainably use resources they control. CBNRM programs can provide this information and training.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">Three conditions are necessary for a community to control a resource. The community must know what their resource rights are, be sure they are enforced and be sure the government or others will not rescind them. Knowing their rights lets the community plan what to enforce. Being able to enforce their rights ensures that others cannot take resources that the community preserves for future use. Being sure the government will not rescind their rights ensures the community can anticipate that it will retain control of resources it invests in or preserves.”</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In recent years, the importance of developing enabling institutional environments has been increasingly acknowledged in the conservation and development fields. Effective institutional frameworks are now regarded as crucial if continuance of positive changes is to be assured. This case study on Kaya forest conservation in Kenya does not describe a process that is in any way complete or even well-advanced. Rather it reports the result of a gradual analysis of the situation and increasing understanding of the institutional need. This has gone on while urgent circumstances have dictated that short- and medium-term activities be undertaken even before any consultation, strategic planning or formulation in the institutional area. Following an analysis of required changes, possible institutional objectives and activities have suggested themselves for the long-term conservation of Kayas. Problems and constraints experienced so far in implementation, and anticipated, are also discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Land tenure lies at the heart of the CBNRM concept — to a certain extent CBNRM is an endeavor to reverse the trend of colonial and post-colonial governments taking land and the control of land out of the hands of rural communities for the protection of natural resources. However, in Botswana, more and more questions have been raised as to the actual ownership and exclusionary rights of communities under CBNRM policy. This paper explores these questions and issues of community land and natural resource tenure under CBNRM in Botswana, by using the words and expressions of stakeholders themselves. The /Xai-/Xai community in western Ngamiland (controlled hunting area NG4) is used as a case study.<br /><br /><strong>Hanna, Susan,</strong> 1998. <em>Co-Management in Small-Scale Fisheries: Creating Effective Links Among Stakeholders</em>. Paper presented at the 1998 International Workshop on CBNRM, Washington, DC.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Establishing effective operational linkages among stakeholders in resource management depends on the institutional environment within which management occurs. As resource-based industries have developed and industrialized, resource management has tended to become specialized and centralized. Centralized management has been fraught with problems and has in many cases proven ineffective in the promotion of long-term sustainability. The centralized approach has often resulted in poorly designed regulations, a lack of buy-in by user groups, low levels of compliance, and ineffective controls on exploitation. As a result, interest in decentralized management approaches has increased. Co-management is the sharing of authority and responsibility among government and stakeholders. The main appeal of co-management is that it offers the prospect of relief from some of the more negative aspects of centralized decision making. This paper discusses establishing effective linkages among stakeholders in the context of small-scale fishery co-management. The main message is that underlying the establishment of linkages among governments and communities are basic economic dynamics that influence the effectiveness of those linkages. These dynamics relate to the transactions costs of co-management and to its requirements for human capital. Examples are provided of fishery co-management, where costs and human capital have played a critical role in the degree of management effectiveness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>· References/Citations: CBNRM&gt;Economic Factors&gt;Perceived Benefits/Costs of CBNRM — “Designers of co-management processes have tended to not give economic concepts like costs and capital due consideration, perhaps because co-management is sometimes seen as a way to avoid economics; a way to mitigate for the harsher side-effects of managing fisheries for economic efficiency. Co-management is often put in place to mitigate some of the problems related to economics, such as competitive exclusion or a failure to address equity…Wishful thinking and desperation are powerful forces. But economic forces are equally powerful, and costs and capital requirements are pervasive. They are reflected in the coordination, learning design, implementation, monitoring and enforcement functions of management. Costs must be accounted for explicitly so they can be contained. Capital must be accounted for explicitly so it can be built or maintained at appropriate levels. A co-management process, while offering great promise for stakeholder integration and long-term commitment, also offers these economic challenges.” (p. 8)<a name="_Hlt511795711" id="_Hlt511795711"></a></p>

However, the challenges and opportunities facing local institutional structures are enormous and it is far from clear, even within a climate of decentralization, how they will be able to shoulder their new responsibilities. One of the main practical issues that needs to be addressed in the short to medium term is presented below: a) ensuring local representation, accountability and participation — decentralization is no guarantee of good local governance. The critical issue is how to ensure a balance of power between the numerous stakeholders in order that all local interests, including those of minority groups, be taken into consideration as groups vie with each other for access to power.”</li>

For example, if an African country were to raise efficiency in the use of its renewable resources by the equivalent of 25 or 50 or 100 percent overall; what would this mean in terms of trends of natural capital use? What would be the impact of doubling the current area in managed forests by substituting managed forest areas for natural forest and woodland areas? Conversely, what change in resource use efficiency would it take to stabilize typical trends in the mining of renewable resources, for an "acceptable" level of depletion of non renewable resources? To provide illustrative answers, the author has developed a simple model of a "typical" African economy. The economy is very simply specified, by main sector of activity, with population, resource endowments and returns to resources combined with labor and other inputs. Depending on the assumptions made on gains in the efficiency of resource use, a range of net domestic resource gains is attained. These gains are then expressed as trends in income per capita, or of a reduction in the rate of loss of natural capital, for a fixed, given level of per capita consumption. <a name="_Hlt505045317" id="_Hlt505045317"></a><a name="_Hlt505045251" id="_Hlt505045251"></a><a name="_Hlt511797630" id="_Hlt511797630"></a></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper explores the role of state law and legal institutions in creating an enabling environment for community-based natural resource management. The starting premise for this paper is that successful community-based management requires “legal regimes that allow local community-based institutions to define, preside over and redefine the rules of resource use” (Lynch, 1998). Designing such legal regimes requires careful attention to the need for certainty and flexibility. Certainty is required in defining the limits of state power, and the rights, responsibilities and remedies of local groups with respect to the state and ‘outsiders.’ Flexibility, on the other hand, is essential to ensure that community-based efforts reflect local conditions, cultural values, and institutional choices. Based upon an examination of emerging practices around the world, some general design principles are offered with respect to a number of issues, including land and resource tenure, defining the objectives of management and other planning matters, recognition of local entities and institutional structures, definition of boundaries, the security rights, and the relationship between different government agencies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Small-scale fisheries in the eastern Caribbean harvest a diverse array of living marine resources. Tuna, swordfish and billfish are among the highly migratory pelagic straddling stocks exploited. More confined to regional and coastal areas are dolphin, flyingfish, wahoo and kingfish among the pelagics, and demersal species such as snapper, reef fishes, sea urchins, lobster and conch. Virtually all of the fishery resources harvested are shared either regionally or internationally at some stage in their life history. The fisheries sectors in these islands are of significant political, economic and social importance in terms of welfare through employment and assurance of income for the coastal poor. However, the contribution to the GDP (typically less than 4%) makes them low priority as engines of economic development. Now, extended marine jurisdiction and other factors have raised the economic development aspirations of fisherfolk and governments, but at the same time there are increasing fisheries management obligations. In the past neither fisherfolk nor governments paid much attention to fisheries management. More recently, through a series of initiatives from the late 1980s to the present, the countries have attempted to involve resource users and other beneficiaries in the establishment and operation of fisheries management regimes. This has meant creating suitable conditions for community-based management. <a name="_Hlt511798878" id="_Hlt511798878"></a></p>

<p><strong>Quote:</strong> “The role of population factors in land degradation processes obviously occurs in the context of the underlying causes. Population pressure operates through giving rise to land shortages, and through other mechanisms as well. Improper agricultural practices, for instance, occur only under constraints such as the saturation of good lands under population pressure which leads settlers to cultivate too shallow or too steep soils, plough fallow land before it has recovered its fertility, or attempt to obtain multiple crops by irrigating unsuitable soils. Concerning water resources, there still is quite some potential for increases in water demand, as economies diversify and living standards rise. Unless large gains are made in efficient use of irrigation water and conservation or rehabilitation of damaged irrigated areas, the crunch is likely <a name="_Hlt512051286" id="_Hlt512051286"></a>to severely damage economic competitivity in addition to health and the quality of life.” (p. 7)</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText3"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Policymakers in Zimbabwe are attempting to address the issue of communal tenure, and to harmonize traditional and statutory approaches. Land resources in Zimbabwe and throughout most of Africa are administered through three overarching tenure systems: state, traditional, and private. In Zimbabwe and elsewhere, the State has legally coopted traditional tenure. However, the State is seriously challenged by customary authorities. Unless and until a reconciliation between the two systems is accomplished, the political will to establish a communal land reform policy will not exist.</p>

<p><strong>Quote:</strong> “CAMPFIRE's central objectives - ecological sustainability, economic efficiency and institutional effectiveness and acceptability - are congruent. This congruency is not however unique to CAMPFIRE. This is a general configuration of compatible objectives and as our organisers point out constitutes much of the appeal for CBNRM approaches universally. What singles out CAMPFIRE from the generality of CBNRM approaches in this congruence is the robust form in which it has been conceptualised. This takes two forms. Firstly, its analysis is a grounded one, taking as its starting point objective realities and constraints, examining alternatives and seeking a direction rationalised on the basis of viability. Secondly, it takes the congruence of its objectives but prioritises their means-and sequence differently to those of most CBNRM approaches which have common currency. To date most CBNRM approaches which have had international inception and support have been crypto-conservationist in their motivational core. A dissonance then arises in that, current state endorsements of the international prioritisation of environmental concerns notwithstanding, the real priorities of these states are economic growth. CBNRM approaches are therefore consistently accorded second-order prioritisation in the national contexts where they are implemented. A further dissonance arises in national contexts. Governments are interested in economic growth, centrally led and controlled. At locality levels the priorities are the appropriation of power and value from the centre. The CAMPFIRE Programme in its conceptual core prioritises the congruent objectives in terms of local appropriation, as a means of economic growth and economic rationality as an incentive for ecological sustainability, thus reversing the means-end sequence implicit in many CBNRM approaches.” (p. 29) <a name="_Hlt511799322" id="_Hlt511799322"></a></p>

Given the vast size of protected areas to be administered, the Government of Tanzania has not been effective in fulfilling its conservation role. Important protected areas are threatened by encroaching farming while some key wildlife species are declining to extinction levels due to imprudent use and shrinkage of habitats. This case study describes efforts to reconcile human interest with nature in the Selous game reserve. The process involved organizing community groups at village, district and central government levels as a preparatory step towards sharing the benefits and costs of conservation. Main lessons from the experience include:</p>
<p>- given the enabling environment (policy, legislation, training and trust) rural communities are managing natural resources in their land prudently;</p>
<p>- the indigenous knowledge of people has to be understood, recognized, and respected, and has to be incorporated in the management of protected areas; and</p>
<p>- in the long run, the natural resources in rural areas can only be sustained by the communities if they are actively committed, if it is understood that access to natural resources is essential for local livelihood, security, and survival, and when communities are responsible for its management.</p>

<p><br />Ostrom, Elinor, 1998. Self-Governance and Forest Resources. Paper presented at the 1998 International Workshop on CBNRM, Washington, DC.<br />Abstract: Forest resources share attributes with many other resource systems that make difficult their governance and management in a sustainable, efficient, and equitable manner. While some ‘forests’ are small enough that fencing them or protecting their borders from intrusion is relatively easy, excluding beneficiaries from access and use of most forests is costly. The difficulty of exclusion creates the possibility that individuals who benefit from the use of a forest will not contribute to its long-term sustainability. For many uses of a forest, one person’s harvesting subtracts products that are not available to others. Thus, many aspects of forests can be considered as common-pool resources. Common-pool resources are characterized by difficulty of exclusion and generate finite quantities of resource units so that one person’s use subtracts from the quantity of resource available to others. The ecosystem services generated by forest resources — watershed protection, carbon sequestration, biodiversity enhancement, etc. — may be considered as externalities or as public goods. Ecosystem services are, however, closely tied to the sustainability of the forest stock, and are thus threatened by the same set of incentives that tempt users of an unregulated forest resource into a race to use up the timber and destroy the forest itself.</p>

The crucial factor is not whether all attributes are favorable but the relative size of the expected benefits and costs they generate as perceived by participants. While all of these variables affect the expected benefits and costs of appropriators, it is difficult — particularly for outsiders — to estimate their impact on expected benefits and costs given the difficulty of making precise measures of these variables and weighing them on a cumulative scale.” (p. 8) <a name="_Hlt511799752" id="_Hlt511799752"></a><a name="_Hlt511799637" id="_Hlt511799637"></a></p>

Social Capital: A Fad or a Fundamental Concept?<br /><strong>Abstract:</strong> Social capital is the shared knowledge, understandings, norms, rules, and expectations about patterns of interactions that groups of individuals bring to a recurrent activity. In the establishment of any coordinated activity, participants accomplish far more per unit of time devoted to a joint activity if they draw on capital resources to reduce the level of current inputs needed to produce a joint outcome. They are more productive with whatever physical and human capital they draw on, if they agree on the way they will coordinate activities and credibly commit themselves to a sequence of future actions. In the realm of repeated coordination problems, humans frequently face a wide diversity of potential equilibria and a nontrivial problem of finding the better equilibria in the set. When they face social dilemma or collective-action situations, participants may easily follow short-term, maximizing strategies that leave them all worse off than other options available to them. Somehow participants must find ways of creating mutually reinforcing expectations and trust to overcome the perverse short-run temptations they face.

<p><strong>Rathgeber, Eva</strong>, 1998<em>. Women, Men, and Water-Resource Management in Africa.</em> IDRC, Nairobi, Kenya.<br /><strong>Quote</strong>: “At a global level, demand for water is increasing steadily, with a general trend toward diversification of use away from agricultural activities. Currently, about 70% of world freshwater resources are used for agricultural purposes, but with rapid global industrialization this is expected to decline to 62% by the year 2000 and to even less thereafter. Moreover, with increasing populations and improved living standards, domestic demand for water has grown significantly in all parts of the world, including Africa. This paper examines some of the concerns that have motivated African governments and donors to become involved with water projects. Although there is general recognition of the needs of "communities" for reliable water systems, it is argued that the different attitudes, perspectives, and needs of women and men with respect to water access and use have been given little focused attention by environmental planners and water-resource managers in Africa. More specifically, it is suggested that throughout the 1970s and 1980s, although concerted efforts were being made to increase water accessibility, little effort was made to integrate the economic roles of women into water-resource planning.” (p. 1)</p>

Most are still grappling with the issues of promoting community organizations and then scaling up participatory approaches and making it sustainable, less demanding of continuing support from development agencies. Public policies for natural resource management have to deal with several issues while evolving an approach for sustainable management in many areas that are environmentally and socioeconomically diverse and fragile. Governments are now seeking to develop new partnerships with local communities. The motivation may be alleviating poverty or regenerating degraded lands or preserving biological diversity and may be economizing on government expenditure — but governments are increasingly seeking ways to encourage the local communities to organize into groups and take responsibility for planning the development and managing the resources that would satisfy their economic and social needs, giving them a sense of ownership of these resources.<em> <a name="_Hlt511801027" id="_Hlt511801027"></a><a name="_Hlt511801146" id="_Hlt511801146"></a><a name="_Hlt511801038" id="_Hlt511801038"></a></em></p>

Proceedings of the February 1999 Sunningdale Workshop on Land Rights and Sustainable Development in Africa. <br /><strong>Key Findings</strong>:</p>
<p>- There are many approaches to addressing land policy and tenure changes in Africa, as well as a growing body of experience with implementing reforms. This provides a sound basis for sharing experience between different countries and stakeholders. A mechanism to facilitate this process of learning lessons would be very valuable.</p>
<p>- Governments have been forced to recognize the relatively limited role they can play in direct allocation and management of land. Nevertheless, they retain an important set of tasks concerning the framework of law and underlying principles. They must establish the authority of those institutions given the powers to manage land and resolve conflicts. Also, there may be need for a significant redistribution of land between different groups.</p>
<p>- Law needs to draw upon the values and aspirations held by society, and cannot be drafted in a vacuum. Hence, widespread consultation processes are needed to permit effective engagement by a broad range of actors, in discussion of proposed legal reforms and the institutional options for implementation.</p>
<p>- Reforms to land tenure and administration have major political implications. Choices must be made about attribution of responsibilities and rights, such as between reliance on established customary systems and the establishment of elected local government structures. In each case, there will be pros and cons, with neither choice offering a perfect solution. Thought must be given to providing checks and balances on the powers attributed, whichever institutional option is chosen.</p>
<p>- Many land reform programs have begun with pilot measures to test out their feasibility and need for amendment before launching a nation wide approach. Use of pilot schemes seems much more appropriate than trying to do everything at once, since it allows for a focus on priority areas where land issues have become acute, as well as learning how best to tailor reforms to fit local conditions.</p>
<p>- Governments face tight budgetary constraints and need to consider the costs of land reform measures in the light of their likely benefits. There may be considerable advantages to building on existing institutions, modified as necessary, rather than trying to establish a brand new set of structures which require staff, operating budgets, and time to establish their legitimacy.</p>
<p>- There has been systematic neglect of resource and tenure systems which do not fall into the neat categories of conventional land law. Hence, pastoral grazing rights, common property resource management systems, the position of women, and the wide range of institutional arrangements by which people gain access to resources always appear, if at all, as an afterthought to debate on land policy. This is despite the enormous importance of the commons for securing rural livelihoods, the pivotal role of women in ensuring the food needs of many farming households, and the economic value of the pastoral livestock sector to many African countries.</p>
<p>- Contempt of customary law remains common in many countries. Even where registration of customary land use is underway, establishing private title to land often remains the underlying purpose of land reform. Yet, registration of collective rights could be a much simpler, cheaper and potentially far more equitable process.</p>
<p>- Processes of land policy and tenure reform take time and require an integrative approach. Establishing new systems and implementing new legislation will require strategic choices to be made, and a feedback mechanism set up to allow amendments to be made as lessons are learned. The many components of civil society have a valuable part to play in helping to guide government position its land policy in relation to social, economic and political objectives.</p>

This focuses attention on linkages among actors having similar interests and capabilities.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper is intended to analyze community benefits from CBNRM, as a means of addressing two key issues at stake, in the implementation of CBNRM activities in Botswana:</p>
<p>CBNRM initiatives in Botswana to date, predominantly focused on generating financial benefits as quickly as possible, for example by selling the entire community wildlife quota to a commercial hunting company. The example was more or less set by the CAMPFIRE approach in Zimbabwe. But do large sums of money acquired by a community in Botswana automatically contribute to an improvement in the living conditions of its people? How are these monies used? How do subsistence economies cope with an increasing commercialization of the available natural resources? Are there no alternative benefits from CBNRM to be generated?</p>
<p>The initial CBNRM initiatives in Botswana were implemented in the north of the country (Chobe district) and for obvious reasons there is a tendency to draw lessons learned from early experiences. However, the context of the project in Chobe is entirely different from situations in other parts of Botswana and depends on the prevailing natural resources and related livelihood strategies, culture and history, levels of material well being and education. The authors argue that the choice of CBNRM approach and related options for the generation and utilization of benefits should be situation-specific.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This work illustrates a knowledge-based approach to modeling focusing on causal relationships among variables. It explicitly recognizes that many relevant variables, such as natural capital, well being, sustainability, human or social capital, among others, are difficult or impossible to measure directly. In the traditional approach, indicators would serve as proxies for these variables, and then statistical analyses might reveal statistical relationships among those indicators. In this systems approach, the emphasis is on the causal relationships among the variables, with less emphasis on the development of regression-ready data. Whereas the traditional approach is well-suited to testing hypotheses, the systems approach is well-suited to developing hypotheses. It is also well-suited to laying out future scenarios that provide answers to “if-then” questions about possible policies, events, or relationships among variables. These future scenarios can help extend the intuition and reach of those decision makers who necessarily operate at, or beyond, the scope of the available data. <a name="_Hlt511802603" id="_Hlt511802603"></a></p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This simulation model is a hypothesis concerning basic ecological-economic relationships in Africa. The model was developed over the course of several months in a series of meetings with experts convened by USAID Africa Bureau’s Office of Sustainable Development (AFR/SD). The model was written in a systems dynamics modeling environment using the Stella simulation-modeling package. The iterative approach of meetings, discussion, and model development is central to the process of forming and reviewing these hypotheses. The model expresses a basic understanding of ecological-economic relationships, and provides a point of focus for the conversation among interested experts. The conversation then informs the process of model development. In this way, insights that follow from the model at one stage of development spur further insights that inform its further development.<a name="_Hlt511802678" id="_Hlt511802678"></a></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper discusses the role which incentive systems can play in supporting natural resources management in dryland areas of the world. The authors present a conceptual framework that can be used to assess past experiences and may help to design appropriate policy and project interventions. The paper concludes that incentive systems are both necessary and feasible to assist resource users to maintain and improve their agricultural production and the natural resources on which this production relies.</p>
<p>· References/Citations: CBNRM&gt;Social Factors&gt;Extent of Ability to Manage&gt;Level of Innovation — “The responsibility for allocating incentives confers power on the giver, which can be misused. Channeling incentives through a local institution can help to build up that body, while shifting the spotlight from project staff. However, local institutions can sometimes be in the grip of particular individuals, and under those circumstances a balance between local and donor institutions may be needed, to ensure the needs of the whole target group are met. Where several projects are operational in one area, there is an urgent need for consistency with regard to the type and level of incentives being offered. Coordination and good working relationships between neighboring projects take time and resources, but are necessary.” (p. 12)</p></div>
