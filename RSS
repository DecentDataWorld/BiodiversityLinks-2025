    <description>This review summarizes evidence for policies and practices across five elements of the agrifood system framework and identifies gaps that inform an agenda for future research. Under availability, imbalanced agriculture policies protect primarily staple food producers, and there is limited evidence on food security impacts for smallholder and women food producers.</description>

    <description>To best understand and tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR), it is necessary to trace the linkages between human, animal, and environmental factors that contribute to AMR transmission via a One Health approach. The African One Health Network for Disease Prevention (ADAPT) seeks to build the capacity for improved, sustainable, locally led management of AMR and neglected tropical diseases, as well as for the stewardship of antimicrobials, across seven sub-Saharan African countries (Uganda, Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, and Sudan) in partnership with state, local, and regional stakeholders.</description>

    <link>https://www.biodiversitylinks.org/learning-evidence/one-health-evidence/one-health-evidence-inbox/oh-benefits-through-cross-sectoral-services.pdf/view</link>
    <description>This chapter describes the added value of One Health through synergies created in delivering integrated healthcare services across health sectors. Current integration is weak and in the context of One Health has a limited scope commonly restricted to ‘integrated surveillance’. In this chapter we use integration to refer to cross-sectoral healthcare/advisory service delivery, where service needs of communities are identified jointly by at least two health sectors, and cross-sectoral planning identifies ways to reach communities more effectively with targeted and relevant services.</description>

    <link>https://www.biodiversitylinks.org/learning-evidence/one-health-evidence/one-health-evidence-inbox/oh-framework-for-service-delivery-turkana-county.pdf/view</link>
    <description>One Health approaches that integrate human and animal health service delivery can help to improve pastoralists’ health through increased vaccine coverage and improved access to services. Kenya has institutionalized One Health at the national level; however, progress at the subnational level has been limited due to sustainability concerns, competing priorities, and insufficient coordination platforms. To address this gap, this paper presents a One Health framework to aid in the implementation of integrated human and animal health policies in Turkana County.</description>
